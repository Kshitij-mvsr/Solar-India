India has set an ambitious target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with solar energy playing a crucial role. 
The country's abundant sunshine, declining solar costs, and supportive government policies have created an ideal environment for solar adoption.

With over 300 sunny days per year in most regions, India receives solar irradiance of 4-7 kWh/mÂ²/day, making it one of the best countries 
globally for solar energy generation.
